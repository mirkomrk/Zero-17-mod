# Zero-17-mod

I have designed XY motor mounts for the Voron 0, upgrading from the original 
NEMA 14 motors to more powerful NEMA 17 motors.
The mounts are one-piece, SLS-printed, featuring:

M8 screw tensioners for motor adjustment.

Integrated pins for idler bearings and belt routing.

Support for smooth steel rods for enhanced precision and durability.

I have redesigned the XY motor mounts for the Voron 0, upgrading from the original NEMA 14 motors to more powerful NEMA 17 motors. 
This upgrade significantly improves speed, force, and acceleration, allowing for higher printing speeds and better motion control.
Key Improvements:

✅ Enhanced Bearing Support
    The original design used an M3 screw to hold the idler bearings, which could introduce flex and instability.
    My design replaces it with a 3mm smooth steel rod, providing greater rigidity, durability, and precision in belt alignment.
    
✅ One-Piece Motor Mount (SLS PA12) vs. Two-Piece FDM ABS
    The original motor mount was split into two halves, assembled using screws, which could introduce misalignment and mechanical weaknesses.
    My design is a single-piece SLS-printed PA12 mount, eliminating assembly weak points and ensuring higher strength, accuracy, and long-term durability.
    
✅ Improved Motor Tensioning System
    The stock tensioning system used a 21-thread integrated tensioner printed in ABS, along with an ABS nut, which could degrade over time due to wear and temperature changes.
    My version uses a metal M8 screw and nut, allowing for precise, repeatable, and more durable tensioning without risk of deformation.
    
✅ Motor Upgrade – From NEMA 14 to NEMA 17
   The switch to NEMA 17 motors provides a significant increase in speed, torque, and acceleration, resulting in better print quality,
   reduced skipped steps, and higher reliability at fast travel speeds.
   
✅Conclusion
   These improvements make the Voron 0 motion system more robust, precise, and reliable, while also simplifying assembly and maintenance.
