# Zero-17-mod

I have designed XY motor mounts for the Voron 0, upgrading from the original NEMA 14 motors to more powerful NEMA 17 motors.
The mounts are one-piece, SLS-printed, featuring:
M8 screw tensioners for motor adjustment.
Integrated pins for idler bearings and belt routing.
Support for smooth steel rods for enhanced precision and durability.
